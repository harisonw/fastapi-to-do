Minimal Complexity (Focus on FastAPI Basics)
Great for beginners or short-term learning.

Features:

CRUD for to-do items (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Store data in memory or use a lightweight database like SQLite.
Basic request validation using Pydantic models.
Minimal routes (e.g., /todos, /todos/{id}).
No user authentication: All requests are open. This is fine for a first API where you want to focus on mastering routing, request/response handling, and data models.

Moderate Complexity (Realistic Small App)
Ideal if you want a practical app but not too overwhelming.

Features:
CRUD for to-do items with proper database integration (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
Add categories or tags for to-do items.
Pagination for listing tasks.
Basic user authentication (e.g., JWT tokens or OAuth2 using fastapi.security).
Persistent user-to-task relationships (e.g., users can only view/edit their own tasks).
Error handling with proper HTTP status codes.
High Complexity (Production-Ready App)
Great for learning advanced FastAPI features or preparing for real-world development.

Features:
Everything in Moderate Complexity, plus:
Full user registration and authentication system (e.g., fastapi-users or a custom implementation).
Role-based access control (e.g., admin vs. regular users).
Integration with a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL with an ORM like SQLAlchemy or Tortoise-ORM).
Tests for endpoints (e.g., using pytest).
Caching (e.g., Redis) to optimize performance.
Async background tasks for long-running operations (e.g., sending email notifications).
Deployed to a cloud provider with CI/CD pipelines.
